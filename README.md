## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.9.13 installed. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To explore the solutions for different machine learning algorithms:

1. [QDA](src/notebooks/q1.ipynb)
2. [LDA](src/notebooks/q1.ipynb)
3. [PCA](src/notebooks/q2.ipynb)
4. [EM](src/notebooks/q3.ipynb)

Open each notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for a detailed view of the solution implementations.

## Features
- Implementation of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) implementation
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) functionality
- Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm implementation

## Configuration
Ensure your Python version and dependencies are compatible with the ones listed above. Any additional configuration steps are detailed in the notebook files.
